- `POST /api/esignature/workflow/budget-approval` - Budget approval workflow
- `POST /api/esignature/customer-agreement` - Customer agreement workflow
- `POST /api/esignature/webhook/inkless` - Webhook for Inkless notifications

#### Inkless Service Integration (`services/inkless_service.py`)
```python
class InklessService:
    - create_signature_request() - Create new signature request
    - send_signature_request() - Send to recipients
    - get_signature_status() - Check current status
    - cancel_signature_request() - Cancel active request
    - download_completed_document() - Get signed PDF

```

### Frontend Architecture

#### Main Components
