## Usage Examples

### Viewing All Company Members
```javascript
// Get all active users
const users = await hrAdminAPI.getCompanyUsers({
  includeInactive: false,
  roleFilter: 'employee'
});

// Display user information
users.forEach(user => {
  console.log(`${user.full_name} - ${user.role} - ${user.documents_count} documents`);
});
```

### Accessing User Files
```javascript
// Get user's complete file information
const userFiles = await hrAdminAPI.getUserFiles(userId, {
  categoryFilter: 'Career Development'
});

// Display file statistics
console.log(`Total documents: ${userFiles.total_documents}`);
console.log(`Storage used: ${formatFileSize(userFiles.total_size)}`);
```

### Company Analytics
```javascript
// Get comprehensive company analytics
const analytics = await hrAdminAPI.getCompanyAnalytics(30); // 30 days

// Display key metrics
console.log(`Total users: ${analytics.total_users}`);
console.log(`Active users: ${analytics.active_users}`);
console.log(`Total documents: ${analytics.total_documents}`);
```

## Installation and Setup

### 1. Database Migration
Run the migration script to create new tables:
```bash
cd backend
python create_hr_admin_tables.py
```

### 2. Backend Setup
The HR admin router is automatically included in the main application:
```python
# In main.py
from app.routers import hr_admin
app.include_router(hr_admin.router, prefix="/api/hr-admin", tags=["HR Admin"])
```

### 3. Frontend Integration
Import and use the HR Admin Dashboard component:
```javascript
import { HRAdminDashboard } from './components/Features';

// Use in your routing
<Route path="/hr-admin" element={<HRAdminDashboard />} />
```

## Compliance and Best Practices

### Data Privacy
- **Minimal Access**: Only necessary data is exposed to HR admins
- **Audit Trails**: All access and actions are logged
- **Data Retention**: Implement appropriate data retention policies

### Security Measures
- **Authentication Required**: All endpoints require valid authentication
- **Role Verification**: Strict role-based access control
- **Input Validation**: All inputs are validated and sanitized

### Monitoring and Alerts
- **Activity Monitoring**: Track unusual access patterns
- **Security Alerts**: Notify administrators of suspicious activities
- **Regular Audits**: Periodic review of access logs and permissions

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Database Connection Errors
- Verify company database URLs are correct
- Check database permissions for new tables
- Ensure all required indexes are created

#### Permission Denied Errors
- Verify user has HR admin role
- Check company association is correct
- Ensure authentication token is valid

#### Missing Data
- Run the migration script to create tables
- Check if user credentials exist
- Verify document associations

### Debug Mode
Enable debug logging in the backend:
```python
import logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)
```

## Future Enhancements
