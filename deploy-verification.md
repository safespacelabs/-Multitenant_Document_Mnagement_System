# CORS Fix Deployment Verification

## Issue Summary
The backend was responding with `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: http://127.0.0.1:3001` instead of the correct production origin, causing CORS errors.

## Changes Made

### 1. Backend Configuration (`backend/app/config.py`)
- ✅ Added debug logging for environment detection
- ✅ Improved CORS origins function to prioritize environment variables
- ✅ Better production vs development handling

### 2. Backend Middleware (`backend/app/main.py`)
- ✅ Enhanced CORS middleware with better logging
- ✅ Improved production vs development origin handling
- ✅ Added debug endpoint `/test-cors`

### 3. Deployment Configuration (`render.yaml`)
- ✅ Added `ENVIRONMENT: production` variable
- ✅ CORS_ORIGINS already correctly configured

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Commit and Push Changes
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix CORS configuration for production deployment"
git push origin main
```

### 2. Verify Render Deployment
- Check that the backend service redeploys automatically
- Verify the environment variables are set correctly in Render dashboard

### 3. Test CORS Configuration
After deployment, test these endpoints:

#### Test CORS Configuration
```bash
curl https://multitenant-backend-mlap.onrender.com/test-cors
```

Expected response should include:
```json
{
  "message": "CORS is working",
  "environment": "production",
  "is_production": true,
  "cors_origins": ["https://multitenant-frontend.onrender.com", "http://localhost:3000", "http://127.0.0.1:3000"]
}
```

#### Test Company Verification Endpoint
```bash
curl -H "Origin: https://multitenant-frontend.onrender.com" \
     -H "Access-Control-Request-Method: GET" \
     -H "Access-Control-Request-Headers: Content-Type" \
     -X OPTIONS \
     https://multitenant-backend-mlap.onrender.com/api/companies/test-company/public
```

Expected headers should include:
```
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: https://multitenant-frontend.onrender.com
Access-Control-Allow-Methods: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, OPTIONS, PATCH, HEAD
Access-Control-Allow-Headers: *
Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true
```

## Verification Checklist

- [ ] Backend service redeployed successfully
- [ ] `/test-cors` endpoint returns production environment info
- [ ] CORS preflight requests work for frontend origin
- [ ] Company verification endpoint accessible from frontend
- [ ] No more CORS errors in browser console

## Troubleshooting

### If CORS still doesn't work:

1. **Check Render Environment Variables**
   - Verify `ENVIRONMENT=production` is set
   - Verify `CORS_ORIGINS` contains the correct frontend URL

2. **Check Backend Logs**
   - Look for CORS middleware debug messages
   - Verify environment detection is working

3. **Test Locally**
   - Run the test script: `python backend/test_cors_fix.py`
   - Check if environment variables are detected correctly

4. **Clear Browser Cache**
   - CORS errors can be cached by the browser
   - Try in incognito/private mode

## Expected Behavior After Fix

- ✅ Frontend can successfully call backend API endpoints
- ✅ Company verification works without CORS errors
- ✅ All API calls from `https://multitenant-frontend.onrender.com` are allowed
- ✅ Development origins still work for local development
- ✅ Production environment properly detected and configured
